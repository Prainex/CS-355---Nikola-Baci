Why we need ExpressJS?
To answer this question, we first need to experience the pain of working with pure NodeJS backend.

To Do:
Set up a NodeJS server and give this page (index.html) to the client when they navigate to the root directory of
localhost:3000

Before, you code the server, double-click and view the index.html file. It is a simple web page for MLK with a title, 3 images and a simple style.css. Your task is to set up the server to display the webpage exactly like that.

Done? Then, now it's time to explore ExpressJS. 

In order to use ExpressJS we need to install it. Open the terminal and type:

```js
npm install express
```

Note the new files and the big folder created! These are used by npm (node package manager), and it means that ExpressJS is installed and ready to use.

Now let's spin our very first ExpressJS server.
