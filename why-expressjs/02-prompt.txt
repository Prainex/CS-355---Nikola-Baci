ExpressJS Starter Package

You can build ExpressJS server from scratch as we did in the first exercise, however there is a simpler way. With the following command in you terminal, you will be able to create a starter project in less than 30 seconds.

```js
	npx express-generator --view=ejs
```

Type this in your terminal and take 5 minutes to explore the files and folders created.
In order to start this new pre-packaged server you have to install all the dependencies that are listed in the package.json:

```js 
	npm install
```

and then you are ready to start the server doing:

```js
	npm start
```
